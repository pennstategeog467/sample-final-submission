# Project: Designing a campus web map
**Student Name:** Aaron Dennis

This is a template for the final submission of all the work you've done on your individual projects in GEOG 467. Right now, you're reading the `README.md` file, which is supposed to explain all the other stuff in the repository/folder.

This is where you should write about the problem you addressed, the work that you did, what you think people could maybe do in the future. Future GEOG 467 students will come here and read about what you did, then download the files and images and everything else that's sitting next to this `README.md` file in the folder/repository.

## What you need to do:

1. Download the zipped version of this repository (see the button on the right).
2. Uncompress the zipped file, then open the folder, then open the `README.md` file (that's this one).
3. Replace the words `Designing a campus web map` on the third line of this file with a title for your individual project.
4. Change `Aaron Dennis` on line 4 to your name.
5. At the *very least*, copy and paste the final written assignment you turned in to Cindy below the line with your name, replacing all other text.
6. Delete the first line about this being an example template.
7. Change the name of the folder from `sample-final-submission` to `your-name` (all lowercase and hyphenated), zip or compress it into a single file, and then email it to my email aaron.p.dennis@gmail.com

It's written in a coding language called "Markdown". I can hear the groans so don't feel you need to worry about it
