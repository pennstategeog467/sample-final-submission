# Project: Designing a campus web map
**Student Name:** Aaron Dennis

This is a template for the final submission of all the work you've done on your individual projects in GEOG 467. Right now, you're reading the `README.md` file, which is supposed to explain all the other stuff in the repository/folder.

This is where you should write about the problem you addressed, the work that you did, what you think people could maybe do in the future. Future GEOG 467 students will come here and read about what you did, then download the files and images and everything else that's sitting next to this `README.md` file in the folder/repository.

It's written in a coding language called "Markdown". I can hear the groans so don't feel you need to worry about it
