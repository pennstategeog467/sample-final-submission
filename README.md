# Project: Designing a campus web map
**Student Name:** Aaron Dennis

This is a template for the final submission of all the work you've done on your individual projects in GEOG 467. Right now, you're reading the `README.md` file, which is supposed to explain all the other stuff in the repository/folder.

This is where you should write about the problem you addressed, the work that you did, what you think people could maybe do in the future. Future GEOG 467 students will come here and read about what you did, then download the files and images and everything else that's sitting next to this `README.md` file in the folder/repository.

## What you need to do:

1. Download the zipped version of this repository (see the button on the right).
2. Uncompress the zipped file, then open the folder, then open the `README.md` file (that's this one).
3. Replace the words `Designing a campus web map` on the third line of this file with a title for your individual project.
4. Change `Aaron Dennis` on line 4 to your name.
5. At the *very least*, copy and paste the final written assignment you turned in to Cindy below the line with your name, replacing all other text.
6. Delete the first line about this being an example template.
7. **Copy clean versions of all the important files you've created for this project into the uncompressed folder, putting them right next to the `README.md`.** Include any code you wrote in text files. Also include `.tm2` folders for Mapbox Studio style projects, **pdf or powerpoint versions of your final powerpoint**, and image files or patterns.
8. Try and explain **each of the files** you added to the folder by writing about them in this README.md
9. Change the name of the folder from `sample-final-submission` to `your-name` (all lowercase and hyphenated), zip or compress it into a single file, and then email it to my email, aaron.p.dennis@gmail.com.

## About this file

Future GEOG 467 students will be reading this to decide if they want to continue working on your project, so the better you document everything you did here, the more likely they are to finish your work.

The `README.md` file is written in a coding language called "Markdown". You really don't have to worry about this, but it's just a way to make documents more readable by allowing you to include headers, lists, code snippets, etc. **Edit this file in a text editor.**

For example, writing a line with a single `#` at the start makes that line into a header, like at the top of the page, and double asterisks around words ( ** ) make the words bold,. Another example: putting text between back ticks ( ` ) makes it into a different font and highlights the text in gray, which usually says to the reader, "This text is computer code."

If you want to use markdown, check out this [cheat sheet](https://github.com/sk1418/markdown-cheatsheet), but if not, just type follow the steps above and type normally, it's all good!

## Including screenshots, other images

To include a screenshot or image, place the image file right next to the `README.md` file in this folder. Then, in the `README.md` file, write first and exclamation point, then a short description of your image in square brackets, then the file name of the image in parentheses directly after the square brackets. Like this: `![my screenshot](screenshot-map-1.png)`.
