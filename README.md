# Project: Designing a campus web map
**Student Name:** Aaron Dennis

This is a template for the final submission of all the work you've done on your individual projects in GEOG 467. Right now, you're reading the `README.md` file, which is supposed to explain all the other stuff in the repository/folder.

This is where you should write about the campus map problem you addressed, the work that you did, what you think people could maybe do in the future. Future GEOG 467 students will come here and read about what you did, then download the files and images and everything else that's sitting next to this `README.md` file in the folder/repository to continue your work.

## What you need to do:

1. Download the zipped version of this repository (see the button on the right).
2. Uncompress the zipped file, then open the folder, then open the `README.md` file (that's this one).
3. Replace the words `Designing a campus web map` on the first line of this file with a title for your individual project.
4. Change `Aaron Dennis` on the second line to your name.
5. At the *very least*, copy and paste the final written assignment you submitted to Cindy into this `README.md`, replacing all other text below the line with your name.
6. **Copy clean versions of all the important files you've created for this project into the uncompressed folder, putting them right next to the `README.md`. It's especially important to include data files.** Include any code you wrote in text files. Also include `.tm2` folders for Mapbox Studio style projects, `.tm2source` folders for and vector tile sources you created, **pdf or powerpoint versions of your final presentations**, and any image files or patterns.
7. Try and explain **each of the files** you added to the folder by writing about them in this `README.md`. It would be really great if you included links/urls to tutorials, documentation, or blog posts you used.
8. Change the name of the folder from `sample-final-submission` to `your-name` (all lowercase and hyphenated), zip or compress it into a single file, and then email it to me, aaron.p.dennis@gmail.com.

## About this file

Future GEOG 467 students will be reading this to decide if they want to continue working on your project, so the better you document everything you did here, the more likely they are to finish your work.

The `README.md` file is written in a coding language called "Markdown", which GitHub then renders all pretty directly below your repository. You really don't have to worry about this, but it's just a way to make documents more readable by allowing you to include headers, lists, code snippets, etc. **Edit this file in a text editor.**

For example, writing a line with a single `#` at the start makes that line into a header, like at the top of the page, and double asterisks around words ( ** ) make the words bold,. Another example: putting text between back ticks ( ` ) makes the text into a different font and highlights the text in gray, which usually says to the reader, "This text is computer code."

If you want to use Markdown, check out this [cheat sheet](https://github.com/sk1418/markdown-cheatsheet), but if not, just follow the steps above and type normally in the `README.md`, it's all good!

## Including screenshots, other images

To include a screenshot or image, place the image file right next to the `README.md` file in this folder. Then, in the `README.md` file, write an exclamation point first, then a short description of your image inside square brackets, then write the file name of the image inside parentheses directly after the square brackets, like this: `![my screenshot](screenshot1.png)`. That bit of text then gets replaced with your picture once it's uploaded to GitHub.


**Thank you for all your hard work this year! It's been very rewarding to see all that we've created. As always, if you have any questions, just let me know!** (create a new Issue on this repository with the button over on the right)
